      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[Replace this with you answer]</p> when wakeUpTime is >= you would get i can take the bus to school and if wakeup time is greater than 7 you would g et i can not take the bus to school.
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[Replace this with you answer]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[Replace this with you answer]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
    </ol>you would get the value of 0 is positive even if you give the variable the value of -0.
